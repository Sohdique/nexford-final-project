# BAN6800 Data Analytics Capstone - Business Analytics Model

## Module 4 Assignment: Business Analytics Model Development

### 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains the final capstone project for BAN6800 Data Analytics, which demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a business analytics model development project. The project combines information from previous modules with Professor's feedback to deliver a comprehensive analytical solution.

### 🎯 Assignment Objectives

This project accomplishes the following key objectives:

- Presents a clear, logical, and coherent line of argument
- Demonstrates the ability to synthesize ideas and business analytics project findings
- Provides detailed critical reflection in analysis and discussion of results
- Critically evaluates current thinking in the discipline and methodologies
- Demonstrates the ability to formulate and test new ideas
- Uses a variety of effective methods, measurements, and techniques of analysis
- Demonstrates the ability to present opinions and model results in a well-structured and convincing way
- Demonstrates the ability to plan, execute, deploy, and monitor a business analytics project with originality
